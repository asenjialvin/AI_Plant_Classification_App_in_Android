# AI_Plant_Classification_App_in_Android
This app uses Convolutional Neural Networks Concepts to deploy ML Models to mobile devices.

Some of the procedures carried out on this app include:
    1. Data set processing (i.e images and pixel conversions)
    2. Neural Networks (how classification and layers work together)
    3. Convolutions (Filters to extract key image features)
    4. Padding and Pooling (methods for data minimization and maximization)
    5. Python ML model creation (using tensorflow, GPUs, TPUs, and Google Colab softaware)
    6. Deploying .tflite models to mobile devices
    7. Testing results with actual samples.
